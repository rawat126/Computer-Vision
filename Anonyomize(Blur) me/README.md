Project
============================================================================================
This code which can convert all Faces inside an image to be Anonymized(by blurring). This only Anonyomize the face and remaining will be same. This can also be worked for the Live video Frame i.e. can also be used for live streaming also. The project was developed as per remembering the point security one's personal data on Public/Private places and also on Social Media.

Practicle Applications of Anonymization : 
============================================================================================
- Privacy and identity protection in public/private areas.
- Protecting children online (i.e., blur faces of minors in uploaded photos)
- Photo journalism and news reporting (e.g., blur faces of people who did not sign a waiver form)
- Dataset curation and distribution (e.g., anonymize individuals in dataset)
- … and more!

### Steps include : 
- first detect faces and then perform face blurring in images and video streams.
- The larger the kernel size, the more blurred the output face will be.
- The second method we’ll be implementing for face blurring and anonymization creates a pixelated blur-like effect 
- Finally the data inside coordinates obtained by face Detection algorithum are blurred by second step

Conclusion : 
=============================================================================================
The conclusion generated by the whole approch discussed above will led to the our results which are depicted in following image
