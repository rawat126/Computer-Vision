Project
============================================================================================
This code which can convert all Faces inside an image to be Anonymized(by blurring). This only Anonyomize the face and remaining will be same. This can also be worked for the Live video Frame i.e. can also be used for live streaming also. The project was developed as per remembering the point security one's personal data on Public/Private places and also on Social Media.

Practicle Applications of Anonymization : 
============================================================================================
- Privacy and identity protection in public/private areas.
- Protecting children online (i.e., blur faces of minors in uploaded photos)
- Photo journalism and news reporting (e.g., blur faces of people who did not sign a waiver form)
- Dataset curation and distribution (e.g., anonymize individuals in dataset)
- â€¦ and more!
