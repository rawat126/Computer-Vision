Q1.) What are different measures to be used accordingly ?
#Ans1 : As the world grapples with COVID-19, it’s
critical that public agencies working to stop the
spread of the virus are equipped to give their 
communities timely and accurate information.
Government agencies and non-profits are handling 
large amounts of data that are changing rapidly, 
and many of them are turning to Power BI to share 
data about COVID-19 with communities in easy-to
-understand maps and dashboards.

Q2.) What can goverment do with power BI desktop ?
#Ans2 : We’re providing a free Power BI toolkit for
state and local governments that enables them to
quickly publish up-to-date COVID-19 information for
their localities. Both Power BI Desktop and the Power 
BI Publish to Web capability are completely free, and
our hope is they can be useful data tracking and 
information sharing tools to agencies that are working 
to combat COVID-19.

Domain. Please Elaborate ?
#Ans3 : Washington State Department of Health (DOH) has 
published multiple interactive Power BI data dashboards. 
Citizens can find current and cumulative case counts, 
COVID-19 testing numbers, detailed demographics of those
affected, and the curve showing the progression of the 
virus in the state’s population. By making these 
dashboards public, Washington State DOH is helping 
citizens explore the data and answer questions.

Services in south-eastern Australia is using Azure and 
Power BI extensively in its public health emergency 
response and was able to quickly create this report 
to share their local information. It’s a great example 
of using data in this time of crisis to keep people 
informed and safer.
