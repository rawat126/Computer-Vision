Project
========================================
This is GUI based project which can convert Digital Text into Human Handwriting. This Project is Build Using Image Processing and computer vision, which will led to lower level of complexity but above average space complextiy, none of the advance approch(like AI) is being used while the obtained results are not much accurate as compare to AI Model but over all they amazing. This idea arises in my mid due to the lockdown in COVID1-19 as my collage requires hand-written assignments(to ensure that students will not just copy-paste the assignments) and my laziness of completing that assignments on time led to this project idea, just make a look.....
