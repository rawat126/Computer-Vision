Project
========================================
This is GUI based project which can convert Digital Text into Human Handwriting. This Project is Build Using Image Processing and computer vision, which will led to lower level of complexity but above average space complextiy, none of the advance approch(like AI) is being used while the obtained results are not much accurate as compare to AI Model but over all they amazing. This idea arises in my mid due to the lockdown in COVID1-19 as my collage requires hand-written assignments(to ensure that students will not just copy-paste the assignments) and my laziness of completing that assignments on time led to this project idea, just make a look.....

Steps Required : 
======================================
- firstly, make the proper dataset of images for Alphabets, special symbol, Numerics etc..

- The proper concatenation of Images according to the mapping of ASCII codes with digital-text, as shown

- The repetation of above steps leds to generation for final desired result.....


Advantages :
======================================
- Used to generate Hand-written Exams from Digital 
- Used to write Collage Assignments where Handwriting is Coumparsary
- GUI Panel make easy to use and the generated output is in PDF format
etc...

Conclusion : 
======================================
The Output will led to generatio of Desired results with proper implementation.....
